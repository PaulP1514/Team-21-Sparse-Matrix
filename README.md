# Sparse Matrices with Linked Lists
URI CSC 212 Spring 2023 Term Project

Group Members: C. Horton, P. Peralta, W. Kingvilay, A. Frias

## Overview
A sparse matrix is a matrix which omits nodes from memory whose values are equal to a default, enabling efficient storage of data mostly comprised of a uniform value. This project provides a C++ implementation of a sparse matrix using linked lists for its rows and columns. It then uses a sparse matrix to generate valid boards for the game Minesweeper.

## How to Use
This project uses the [``color-console``](https://github.com/aafulei/color-console) library to color-code the outputted Minesweeper board in the console.

### Installation
- Download files from this repo
- Download [color.hpp](https://github.com/aafulei/color-console/blob/master/include/color.hpp) to the same directory as the files from this repo

### Usage

## Group Guidelines
All team members will make at least some contribution to the code. However, each team member has an additional specialty:
| Team Member | Specialty |
|--|--|
| C. Horton | GitHub management |
| P. Peralta | Presentation |
| W. Kingvilay | Report |
| A. Frias | Presentation |

It is up to each team member to cover the area designated by their specialty, and to assist one another as requested.
