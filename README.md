# Sparse Matrices with Linked Lists
URI CSC 212 Spring 2023 Term Project

Group Members: C. Horton, P. Meralta, W. Kingvilay, A. Frias

### Overview
A sparse matrix is a matrix which omits nodes from memory whose values are equal to a default, enabling efficient storage of data mostly comprised of a uniform value. This project provides a C++ implementation of a sparse matrix using linked lists for its rows and columns, as well as a game of Minesweeper using a sparse matrix to store the playing board.
